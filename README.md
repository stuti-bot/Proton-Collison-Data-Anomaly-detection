# Proton-Collison-Data-Anomaly-detection
Jupyter Notebook performing EDA and unsupervised anomaly detection on the CERN MultiJet dataset. An IsolationForest model is used to identify rare collision events relevant to new physics searches, successfully flagging events with high mass (MR), imbalance (Rsq), and missing energy (MET).
